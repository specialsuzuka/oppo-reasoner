meta_planer,"I am Alice. My teammate Bob and I want to transport as many target objects as possible to the bed with the help of containers within 3000 steps. I can hold two things at a time, and they can be objects or containers. I can grasp containers and put objects into them to hold more objects at a time.
Assume that you are an expert plan outline designer. Given our shared goal, please help me generate a global meta plan for me and Bob during task execution, guiding me and Bob to achieve the goal collaboratively as soon as possible. Note that a container can contain three objects, and will be lost once transported to the bed. I can only put objects into the container I hold after grasping it. All objects are denoted as <name> (id), such as <table> (712). Actions take several steps to finish. It may be costly to go to another room or transport to the bed, use these actions sparingly.
The generated meta plan must meet following requirements:
1.There are 5 allowed actions you can use to construct the meta plan. 
    1) ‘go to’: move to a specified room. 
    2) ’explore’: explore a room for underlying target objects. 
    3) ‘go grasp’: go to grasp a specified target object. 
    4) ‘put’: Place an object into a specified container. 
    5) ’transport’: Transport holding objects or containers to the bed and drop them on the bed.
2.The meta plan should be concise, brief, and reliable.
3.The meta plan must be structured strictly in the three-step format: {Action Plan: Step 1:
Alice xxx, Bob xxx; Step 2: Alice xxx, Bob xxx; Step 3: Alice xxx, Bob xxx}. Here, 'xxx'
represents one or multiple allowed actions. The actions in Step 1 are of the highest execution
priority, while those in Step 2 and Step 3 are of medium and lowest execution priority.
4.The meta plan should reasonably arrange the division of action between Alice and Bob in
order to achieve the goal as soon as possible.
Here is an example for you:
{Goal: [Transport 3 pens, 1 lighter, and 3 iPods to the bed.]
Meta plan: [Step 1: Alice explores the current room. Bob explores the current room.
Step 2: If any target objects are found, Alice and Bob go grasp objects, put them into
containers, and transport them to the bed.
Step 3: Alice goes to one of the remaining rooms and explores it. Bob goes to one of the
remaining rooms and explores it]}
Goal: $GOAL$
Given the above goal, think step by step, and generate the meta plan:"

Assume that you are an excellent leader for coordinating the task. Given our shared goal, meta plan, dialogue history, latest progress, and my previous actions, please help me generate a message sent to Bob, in order to share my progress and inquire the opinion of Bob about the meta plan.

The generated message should strictly meet following requirements:
The message has to be concise, reliable, and helpful for assisting Bob and me to make an efficient and consistent action plan, and transport as many objects to the bed as possible.
Don't generate repetitive messages.
Here is an example of generated massage for you:
Example:
{Message: Hi Bob, I am exploring the <living room> (2000) and I found <apple> (1242543)
there. I made an action plan to guide us to complete the task efficiently. Do you have any
suggestions for the action plan according to your latest progress?}

2.The message must strictly be in the following format: {Main message: a detailed opinion
and suggestions of Bob about the action plan. Satisfaction level: Yes or No, decide whether
you are satisfied with the current action plan.} You should consider the progress of both Alice
and Bob in determining the satisfaction level and providing suggestions for the action plan.
3.If you are not satisfied with the current action plan, please point out the reason and your
suggestion on how to modify the action plan in the message. You can suggest the next action
for Alice in the message to achieve the goal as soon as possible.

considering that I found an <wood\_basket> (1870213) and <plastic\_basket>(1843721) in
the <office>(2000), I think I should grasp <wood\_basket> (1870213), I suggest you to go to
